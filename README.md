# OpenCV-Learning-StanleyWei
 Personal repository for learning/practicing basic OpenCV.

Am ~80% done with my first project so far. Remaining tasks are mostly code cleanup/reorganization, commenting, testing + refinement, as well as some other tests I want to run that aren't really part of the main assignment (e.g. identifying the distance fromt the rings, angle of the rings).

Material covered:
Loading and displaying images (Chapter 3)
Coordinate points (Chapter 4)
Drawing rectangles (Chapter 5)
Bitwise operations, masking, splitting channels, merging channels, and color spaces (Chapter 6)
Blurring (Chapter 8)
Thresholding (Chapter 9)
Edge Detection (Chapter 10)
Contours (Chapter 11)

Also used manual thresholding in the program, which
